Literal idiot goes "hm I feel like making a theme for NotITG, what could go wrong"

Please note that this theme is far from finished and needs a lot of     things  
For example:
- The rest of the missing Screens
- The rest of the missing BGAnimations
- Custom Audio
- A whole lot of polishing in metrics.ini
- Removal of redundant functions that I copied from other themes

Other than that there are a couple things planned:
- Addition of custom backgrounds
-- Priority: [this type of background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVWZfvmra54) (and probably the general theme of it hehe)
- Half or so of the funny things included in [this theme](https://github.com/oatmealine/simply-love-oat-fork)
- Proobably integration for some external download hub?? idk but imagine osu!direct but stepmania style
- Profiles (I probably need to ask BrightXeno for this)
- Customizable default options (probably, I might still need static.ini for some things)

if you have any funny ideas you can throw in a pull request (although at this super early stage I don't except any pr's)
